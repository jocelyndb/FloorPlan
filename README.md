# Floor Planner
My personal project for this semester is a tool for 
constructing architectural floor plans. This tool should allow
users to create projects of arbitrary size and floor count.
Users should be able to construct a floor plan for any structure
they can invent given that said structure only involves rectangular 
rooms and furniture with rectangular bounds. Floors will contain
connected rooms which will contain furniture. Users should not be
able to place furniture on top of other furniture and also be 
able to enforce minimum distances between pieces of furniture
as well as wall sizes. This project will be used by interior 
designers and architects. This project is personally interesting 
to me as I've always enjoyed redesigning the interior of the 
spaces I've lived in. Having a tool to change things around on 
the fly and try out new configurations would be quite useful.

Though interior designers may be interested in using this application, I 
intend to prioritize the needs of architects during my design.
This means that I intend to design a function to render, 
for completed projects, a floor plan that an architect 
would be able to use to their specifications.

_I will be researching exactly what this will look like when I
reach that stage of the project_
